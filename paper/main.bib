  abstract  = "The process of aging includes changes in cellular biology that
               affect local interactions between cells and their environments
               and eventually propagate to systemic levels. In the brain, where
               neurons critically depend on an efficient and dynamic supply of
               oxygen and glucose, age-related changes in the complex
               interaction between the brain parenchyma and the
               cerebrovasculature have effects on health and functioning that
               negatively impact cognition and play a role in pathology. Thus,
               cerebrovascular health is considered one of the main mechanisms
               by which a healthy lifestyle, such as habitual cardiorespiratory
               exercise and a healthful diet, could lead to improved cognitive
               outcomes with aging. This review aims at detailing how the
               physiology of the cerebral vascular system changes with age and
               how these changes lead to differential trajectories of cognitive
               maintenance or decline. This provides a framework for generating
               specific mechanistic hypotheses about the efficacy of proposed
               interventions and lifestyle covariates that contribute to
               enhanced cognitive well-being. Finally, we discuss the
               methodological implications of age-related changes in the
               cerebral vasculature for human cognitive neuroscience research
               and propose directions for future experiments aimed at
               investigating age-related changes in the relationship between
               physiology and cognitive mechanisms.",
