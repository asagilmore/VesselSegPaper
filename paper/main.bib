               demonstrated that age-associated alterations of the human brain
               may be at least partially related to vascular alterations.
               Relatively little information has been published on vascular
               changes associated with healthy aging, however. The study
               presented in this paper examined vessels segmented from
               standardized, high-resolution, magnetic resonance angiograms
               (MRAs) of 100 healthy volunteers (50 males, 50 females), aged
               18-74, without hypertension or other disease likely to affect the
               vasculature. The subject sample was divided into 5 age groups
               (n=20/group) with gender equally distributed per group. The
               anterior cerebral, both middle cerebral, and the posterior
               circulations were examined for vessel number, vessel radius, and
               vessel tortuosity. Males exhibited larger vessel radii regardless
               of age and across all anatomical regions. Both males and females
               displayed a lower number of MRA-discernible vessels with age,
               most marked in the posterior circulation. Age-associated
               tortuosity increases were relatively mild. Our multi-modal image
               database has been made publicly available for use by other
               investigators.",

  abstract  = "The process of aging includes changes in cellular biology that
               affect local interactions between cells and their environments
               and eventually propagate to systemic levels. In the brain, where
               neurons critically depend on an efficient and dynamic supply of
               oxygen and glucose, age-related changes in the complex
               interaction between the brain parenchyma and the
               cerebrovasculature have effects on health and functioning that
               negatively impact cognition and play a role in pathology. Thus,
               cerebrovascular health is considered one of the main mechanisms
               by which a healthy lifestyle, such as habitual cardiorespiratory
               exercise and a healthful diet, could lead to improved cognitive
               outcomes with aging. This review aims at detailing how the
               physiology of the cerebral vascular system changes with age and
               how these changes lead to differential trajectories of cognitive
               maintenance or decline. This provides a framework for generating
               specific mechanistic hypotheses about the efficacy of proposed
               interventions and lifestyle covariates that contribute to
               enhanced cognitive well-being. Finally, we discuss the
               methodological implications of age-related changes in the
               cerebral vasculature for human cognitive neuroscience research
               and propose directions for future experiments aimed at
               investigating age-related changes in the relationship between
               physiology and cognitive mechanisms.",
